<h1>The Best anime According To E.Ziyaad</h1>
 <h2>My top 3 anime of all time</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>Naruto</h3>
 <p>My first ever anime that i have ever watched,the characters are just the best and the stories as well.</p>

 <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
 <p>It is an anime where characters possess curse energies and use them as weapon,the strongest sorcerors are Satorou Gojo,Suguru geto and Itadori yuji.</p>

 <h3>Dragon ball Z</h3>
 <p>unfortunately,i have not watched all the episodes yet but as long as i can remember the chapters are pretty awesome so are the characters.</p>
